Random Ideas that I want to keep track for potential future projects of or find existing projects that fulfill them

# About this repo
Often I have random ideas that would make a potentially interesting project at "sometime" (often never even gets started) in the future.

On the odd occasion when I'm smart enough to actually write them down in a text file they usually get lost in the filesystem and never found again.

Instead we can roughly insert them into this repo with the intent of future research at some point to see if something that meets most of the idea already exists and should something keep my interest and not already exist consider making it myself.

If someone else finds something that may qualify they are welcome to submit a pull request.
